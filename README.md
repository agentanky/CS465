In the Travlr Getaways project, we used different types of frontend development. We started with Express HTML and JavaScript, which involved rendering web pages on the server side. This method is simple and good for search engine optimization (SEO) but can be slower and less interactive for users. We also used a single-page application (SPA) framework like Angular, which loads the entire app on a single page and updates content dynamically without refreshing. This makes the app faster and more responsive for users.

For the backend, we chose a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDB is good at handling large amounts of unstructured data and allows us to make changes to the database easily without complex migrations. This flexibility is useful for rapid development and adjustments.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is different from JavaScript even though they are related. JSON is a lightweight data format used to exchange data between a server and a client. It ties the frontend and backend together by allowing the frontend to send and receive data in a structured format that the backend can easily process. During the project, we often refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. One major benefit was creating reusable user interface (UI) components, which made our code cleaner and easier to maintain.

Testing in a full stack application involves checking different API endpoints to ensure they work correctly. This can be challenging, especially with added security layers like authentication. We needed to ensure our methods and endpoints were secure and functioned as expected. This course has helped me reach my professional goals by teaching me important skills like frontend and backend development, using databases, and ensuring security in applications. These skills make me a stronger candidate in the tech field.
